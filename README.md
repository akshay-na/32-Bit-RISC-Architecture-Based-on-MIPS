# 32-Bit-RISC-Architecture-Based-on-MIPS

ECE Final year major project.

Using Cadence, Xilinx, and Verilog HDL, we designed a high-performance 32-Bit RISC Microprocessor with Interlocked Pipeline Stages. The design of this processor is developed using the Hardware Description Language (HDL) - Verilog in the ModelSim simulator. The supreme aim of this project is to develop the RTL logic design using the Xilinx tool.

In the given time frame we were managed to complete the simulation of the microprocessor.
